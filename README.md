# Attack on Blocks #

This take on space invaders was written for my IT BTEC course, Unit 21 Games Development at college. This version, written in python, includes more advanced features such as resource packs. 

### Requirements ###

* Python 3
* Pygame
* TKinter

The game is only playable on windows, due to the GUI library only being available on windows. However a cross platform, lightweight version may be made in the future.

### Playing the game ###

* Clone the repository, or visit the downloads page
* Install the required libraries (See Above)
* Run 'Play The Game.py'

### Core Contributors ###

* Jake Howard
* Furhan Bhatti (Well not really)
